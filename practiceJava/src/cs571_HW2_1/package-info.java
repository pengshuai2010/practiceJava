/**
 * Item class includes three data members: tile, origUnitPrice, quantity
 * Item class also includes getters and setters as wells as a getItemTotal method to calculate 
 * total price of this item.
 * 
 * There two JUnit test class to test the Item class and Sale class. Very simple methods such as 
 * getter and setters are not tested since testing them virtually means to test the JVM itself, and 
 * we can assume that JVM has already been well tested.
